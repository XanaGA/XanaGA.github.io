## Personal Profile

My main interest is Machine Learning and its application to computer vision, robotics and 3D understanding. I am always learning about the latest technologies (NeRF, diffusion models, etc.), while maintaining a strong grasp of foundational concepts. My skills combine a solid mathematical background with practical implementations by programming. With these, I aim to contribute to discovering new ways in which machine learning can help improve computer vision, AR, graphics, and autonomous systems.

## Undergraduate Final Thesis (TFG)

Neural fields are neural networks that take spatiotemporal coordinates as input and output values for those points. One of the most well-known applications is Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs); however, they span robotics, graphics, and shape representation. This TFG presents fundamental concepts from differential geometry (differentiability, curvature) to process shapes represented as signed distance functions (SDFs) approximated by neural networks. It covers background needed for shape smoothing and sharpening directly on the implicit representation, as proposed in "Geometry Processing with Neural Fields" (NeurIPS 2021). We study both geometry and neural basics, including mesh‑to‑implicit conversion.
